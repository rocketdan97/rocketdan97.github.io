But there's actually a pretty cool, straightforward philosophical idea being presented here (the <a href="www.sparknotes.com/lit/stranger/themes">Sparknotes</a> is useful if it went over your head like it did mine).

          Leovy’s nonfiction account of a murder in L.A. reads like a detective novel. She cuts through the politics to present one way to reduce black-on-black violence: more thorough investigations. Very well-researched, very emotional, and deeply concerned with preserving black lives.

But my favorite parts of the book were toward the end, when she discusses the difficult adjustment to life in the US. We often cut off stories when the protagonist makes it out of danger, but Sandra's descriptions of what happens after the credits roll lands well.

She nails the feeling of being talked down to by racially insensitive (or racially oversensitive) liberals.

There were a lot of reasons she lost, and this book goes through them carefully using the best evidence available.

          It’s hard to find science writing that's a little meatier than pop science but doesn't feel like homework. I think Greene nails it here. His use of accessible analogies and detailed footnotes makes the book easy to pick up without being too hand-wavey.

            I love that Snicket doesn’t shy away from showing death. He says losing someone is like walking up some stairs, expecting one more step, and then feeling a jolt when your foot keeps falling. I doubt many children’s novels should address death as honestly and sensitively as this one.

The high school students here are witty, thoughtful, and written with care.

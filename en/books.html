        <td>The argument in the book is valid (i.e., the conclusions follow from the premises): unwarranted skepticism toward police puts black lives at risk by making cops less proactive. But by not discussing how the War on Drugs lands on minority communities (she discusses disparities in crack and cocaine sentencing while ignoring pretty much everything else about drug enforcement) and by frequently making use of inflammatory anecdotes, MacDonald has written a book for people who already agree with her. Where <i>The New Jim Crow</i> ignores disparities in violent crime rates, The War on Cops ignores equivalent drug usage rates in its arguments about race and policing.

The absence of an extended discussion of elevated violent crime rates in minority communities and some tenuous historical allusions (she argues building prisons in rural areas boosts population and thus congressional representation in white majority areas in a manner reminiscent to the three-fifths compromise) detract from an otherwise compelling argument.

          This is simply not the book I was looking for, and I was deeply disappointed as a result. Sarah Bakewell is far more concerned with the lives and dramas of the philosophers mentioned than their ideas. I can see why some people would be into that, but I find existentialist ideas far more interesting than how they saved Heidegger's manuscripts during World War II.

      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This is a beautifully written "America is more racist than you think" book, with all the strengths and failures of the genre: lovely prose, strained analogies, a firm grasp of history, and no vision for the future. For whatever reason it gives no consideration to Asian, Latin, or Native Americans, glancing at America's racial hierarchy only at its top and bottom. Not worth your time if you've read this kind of thing before.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Carol Dweck has done decades of research showing people who view skills as the result of effort are more successful than people who view skills as innate. Apparently these are some of the most bulletproof, replicable studies out there. But she's way better at psychology than writing for a popular audience. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/little-children.jpeg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">The title here is a double entendre: the book concerns adults acting like kids and a pedophile who moves into their neighborhood. Not much really happens. But Perotta's vivid characters and punchy dialogue carry the <i>Desparate Housewives</i> style plot threads.</p>
    </div>

      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Parents aren't always upfront about how unpleasant babies can be. Mike Birbiglia is, and he's funny about it. Very honest and kind of redeeming at the end.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/benjamin-franklin.jpeg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">There seems to have been little internal struggle in Benjamin Franklin's life. He decided on some values when he was young, applied them to his daily life, and then accomplished a lot. Though incomplete and written in bits and pieces, this autobiography is a fascinating portrait of an American ubermensch. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/amusing-ourselves-to-death.jpeg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Neil Postman's cranky but visionary screed argues entertainment and distraction hollow out culture and politics. Written thirty years before Twitter and a reality TV president, Postman's claims are prophetic. The book's hectoring tone does detract from its insight.</p>
    </div>

      <img src="books-images/are-prisons-obsolete.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">If the book were called "Are Prisons Bad?" it would be a success—Davis highlights various problems with prisons in well-researched, accessible prose. But it's called "Are Prisons Obsolete?" and it fails as an abolitionist text because Davis' alternative to prisons is hazily-defined socialism and the end of crime. Davis puts the question "What about rapists and murderers?" in scare quotes, but never actually answers it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/utopia-for-realists.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">The premise of the book makes sense: we should have broad utopian goals and avoid getting mired in technocratic iteration. But Bregman argues for basic income, open borders, and shorter work weeks with no consideration for counterarguments, and no reason to believe these are utopian ideals rather than policies governments should adopt now. He oversells his argument, but Bregman's broader point about the value of utopian thinking is sound and important.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/a-promised-land.png" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">President Obama does two things well here: he offers a good sense of what it's like to be president and he's an excellent apologist for the Obama Administration. While a bit self-serving at times (not quite <i>The Last Dance</i>-bad but approaching it), this is a well-written, fascinating memoir. Anyone interested in politics will love reliving moments like Henry Louis Gates' arrest or the Deepwater Horizon tragedy from the White House's perspective.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="row">

      <img src="books-images/how-asia-works.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Studwell discusses some rich countries and some poor countries in Asia that were at about the same starting point following the Second World War. The rich countries did three things the poor ones didn't according to Studwell: land reform to promote small-scale agriculture, tempering large manufacturing subsidies with what he calls "export discipline" (the practice of only subsidizing globally competitive companies), and a "tight leash" on the financial system to keep capital flowing into agriculture and manufacturing. His argument is clear, persuasive, and rich with examples.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/tightrope.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">I live about 35 minutes away from Yamhill, Oregon and was excited to read Nicholas Kristof write about the undoing of his hometown. But only about a third of this book takes place in Yamhill—the rest wanders through random places in the US to present unoriginal liberal takes on various social issues. I agree with the arguments here, but the book is shallow and disappointing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/second-mountain.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">David Brooks' life advice is so much better than his political commentary. He describes two stages of life: a first mountain where one climbs toward money, power, and worldly success; and then a second mountain where one ascends toward higher values. Brooks shows a strong grasp of the moral pulse of America, though his advice is sort of geared at everyone and no-one.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/shallows.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Writing before smartphones were ubiquitous, Carr explains how the internet changes our thinking. The book is deeply researched, discussing neuroplasticity and how brains have historically adapted to new communication technologies. Carr expresses the urgency of not misusing the web without histrionics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/scrambling-for-africa.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Crane uses an HIV clinic in Uganda to make an alarming argument: global health initiatives tend to "create and rely upon" the inequalities they are designed to fix. I wasn't convinced. While there's an enormous power difference between the Ugandan patients and Western doctors, the injustices that come out of it seem minor relative to work being done on HIV.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/cynical-theories.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Lindsey and Pluckrose bring clarity to inscrutable trends in academia, presenting the most lucid explanations of "postmodernism" and "critical theory" I've seen. But the book assumes more social justice than exists in the world, particularly with regard to gay and transgender people. As it becomes more polemic toward the end, it sometimes treats activism as unnecessary.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/locking-up-our-own.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This is the best book I've read in a long time. Michelle Alexander left a gaping hole in <i>The New Jim Crow</i> by not discussing violent crime or initial black support for mass incarceration. Forman plugs it with precision and righteousness in this detailed exploration of 1970s carceral politics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/until-we-reckon.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Sered's case for restorative justice responses to violent crime starts strong then falters. Her explanations for why prison doesn't work are detailed and persuasive, but she follows them up with weak, anecdote-driven arguments for restorative justice alternatives. That this book makes no mention of the violent crime's dramatic fall over the past thirty years is telling—Sered is here for ideological musings, not solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/how-to-be-an-antiracist.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Who would look at American politics and think we need to define "racism" in such a way that tax cuts are racist? Why not just come up with a new word? Adam Serwer said history books make the best antiracist texts—they're certainly more enlightening that watching Kendi play semantic games.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/white-fragility.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Not good. White fragility is a useful concept, but it's packaged really poorly here and the term is snarky for no reason. I wrote more about it <a href=writing/white-fragility.html>here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/white-identity-politics.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Ashley Jardina's explores years of survey data regarding people who strongly identify as white. By looking at white identity through the lens of in-group affection rather than out-group hostility, she makes some interesting insights. For example, white identifiers tend to be indifferent to affirmative action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/politics-of-resentment.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This is the platonic ideal of the interview with Trump supporters in a Midwestern diner. Katherine Cramer, a native Wisconsinite, published this book months before the 2016 election after working on it for almost a decade. Her conversations tease out the dynamics of rural resentment—it's more subtle than racism or economic anxiety.</p>

      <img src="books-images/where-do-we-go.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Martin Luther King's writing is just as beautiful as his speaking. In this, his last book before his death, he paints a picture of a second phase of the Civil Rights Movement that moves beyond treating black people with decency and strives for material equality. He was a minister and not an economist, so I'm not sure about the viability of his UBI schemes, but his thoughts on the activism of his time are as relevant as ever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/democracy-for-realists.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">In what Achens and Bartels call the "folk theory of democracy," democracy works because government is responsive to informed citizens voting in their self interest. Since voting behavior is largely determined by identity and other factors unrelated to the effectiveness of elected officials, Achens and Bartels argue the folk theory of democracy is a bad way to look at things. The path forward from this conclusion is hazy, but their assertion that group identities are central seems correct.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/a-thousand-splendid-suns.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This book is so unfair! It's page after page of two Afghan women facing unbearable sexism. Khaled Hosseini writes sensitively about how in response to oppression they at times turn against one another and at others band together.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/doing-justice.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">The "I got fired by Trump and need to cash out while I'm relevant" genre of political memoir is rife with dumb palace intrigue, self-righteousness, and hurried writing. Happily Preet Bharara's book mostly sidesteps these pitfalls. Bharara writes candidly about his time running the country's most famous prosecutor's office, with only the occasional low-effort, anti-Trump bromide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/tout-commence-mal.gif" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This mostly faithful translation of the opening book in A Series of Unfortunate Events captures Lemony Snicket's tone well. Some of the wordplay is missing (e.g., Al Funcoot is an anagram of Count Olaf, while Alfred Tourtebuse n'a rien à voir avec le comte Olaf). But on the whole, this is a great read for people learning French, especially if you read these books as a kid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/why-were-polarized.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Klein sees our country as no more divided than it was in the middle of the last century. Segregationist Southern Democrats were not aligned with other Democrats, preventing the country's divisions from neatly mapping onto its politics the way it does today. Klein's conclusion that we were always polarized is a bit too cute.</p>
    </div>

      <img src="books-images/uneasy-peace.jpeg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">The recent, historic drop in violent crime has had as great a public health benefit for young black men as would the eradication of obesity. Sharkey suggests methods for reversing the recent uptick in crime and continuing the broader, positive trend without the sort of aggressive policing and prosecution that harms minority communities. His lucid writing comes from a place of careful study rather than ideology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/against-empathy.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">When Bloom says empathy, he doesn't mean compassion or even imagining what someone else is experiencing. He means literally feeling what another person feels. While the book builds on a nit-picky definition, he argues well that our ability to relate to others is too biased and unreliable to form the basis of our morals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/handmaids-tale.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Atwood builds a detailed world that unlike many dystopias becomes more plausible the further one reads. There's not much subtlety at first, and the book kind of beats you over the head with its message. But as the power dynamics come into focus and Offred's character grows in dimension, the book becomes more interesting.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/climate-justice.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Reading this made me feel like I was going to be asked to donate to something. Mary Robinson presents hopeful stories of people fighting climate change. I like the framing of climate change as a moral issue and a feminist issue, but it's hard not to roll one's eyes at writing that seems geared toward the sort of people who attend international conferences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/bullshit-jobs.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">David Graeber's viral 2013 essay "On the phenomenon of bullshit jobs" exposed a number of meaningless jobs that could disappear overnight with no effect on the world (or even a positive effect). Released five years later, this book adds a more detailed bullshit job typology and bullshit job testimonies from people suffering the spiritual violence of knowing their work is entirely pointless. The book is funny and incisive, though overstated at times.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/dorian-gray.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This book is full of ideas. I sprinted through it and felt like I missed a lot of interesting thoughts on art and ethics. It's a fun story, but definitely not a light read.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/meritocracy-trap.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">Most progressive critics of inequality support meritocracy; the system is seen as unjust because rich people cheat or because minorities are discriminated against. But Markovits argues meritocracy is itself the problem, restructuring the economy in ways that hollow out the middle class and creating an ever-narrowing band of meritocratic elites working inhumane hours. Though his alternatives are underdeveloped, he makes a thorough and convincing case for reconsidering standard redistributive fixes to inequality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/socialist-manifesto.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify">This book is a good introduction to socialism, but there's a jarring tonal shift after the first chapter. It starts with a whimsical thought experiment exploring the downsides of capitalism and the dream of a truly egalitarian socialist society from the perspective of a worker in a pasta sauce factory run by Bon Jovi's family. Then the book takes a sharp turn to some dry history, with lines like "The seeds of what would become Second International Marxism were apparent in the SDAP program, but when the party merged with the ADAV six years later to form the twenty-thousand-strong Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAP), the new organization's founding document had a distinct Lassallean flavor."</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/war-on-cops.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="text-justify"> Heather MacDonald argues unwarranted skepticism toward police puts minorities at risk by making cops less proactive. But by not discussing drug law enforcement beyond the crack/cocaine disparity and frequently making use of inflammatory anecdotes, MacDonald writes for people who already agree with her. Where <i>The New Jim Crow</i> ignores disparities in violent crime rates, The War on Cops ignores equivalent drug usage rates, and its arguments suffer as a result.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="test-justify">This book is an excellent primer on Rwandan history and politics. Joseph Sebarenzi is fair and played a key role in his country's story. It's a very readable memoir that moves at a good clip.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/a-time-to-kill.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="test-justify">This book drags. The premise is interesting: in a small Mississippi town in the late 80's, a black man kills the white men who raped his daughter and faces trial. But it's clear this is John Grisham's first crack at a novel, with endless hearings and motions and arraignments and the stuff they cut out off Law and Order.</p>

      <img src="books-images/all-about-love.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="test-justify">The first three chapters are great: bell hooks presents a clear definition of love and describes how most people don’t experience it. But then she abandons that definition and starts writing crazy shit like “if all public policy was created in the spirit of love, we would not have to worry about unemployment, homelessness, schools failing to teach children, or addiction.” In hooks’ world, everything bad is because of mass media and the patriarchy, and it could all be fixed if we loved each other.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="test-justify">People of all races use drugs at about the same rates, but the War on Drugs and the resulting explosion in incarceration rates has disproportionately landed on minority communities. Michelle Alexander argues that mass incarceration is a system of racial control of the same scale and nature as slavery and Jim Crow. The absence of an extended discussion of elevated violent crime rates in minority communities and some tenuous historical allusions (she argues building prisons in rural areas boosts population and thus congressional representation in white majority areas in a manner reminiscent to the three-fifths compromise) detract from an otherwise compelling argument.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <img src="books-images/the-stranger.jpg" alt="fig-1" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="max-width:60%;height:auto;">
      <br>
      <p class="test-justify">Camus' writing is clear and easy to read. He puts the main character in a bunch of awkward situations that seem to accumulate without cohering. But there's actually a pretty cool, straightforward philosophical idea being presented here (the <a href="www.sparknotes.com/lit/stranger/themes">Sparknotes</a> is useful if it went over your head like it did mine).</p>

Every pane looks at the same spot, but varies across time, ranging from millions of years in the past to thousands of years in the future. Richard McGuire's creative exploration of the scale of our time on the planet shows what we're doing to the climate.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Racial dynamics in Portland are interesting because the city is very progressive, but also has an exclusionary past that has led to a tiny, fairly marginalized minority population. Renée Watson explores all this through the lens of a black high school student who buses across town to a fancy private school. She nails the feeling of being talked down to by racially insensitive (or racially oversensitive) liberals.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Many people frame this book as an airing of grievances, but while there's a small amount of griping, it's a pretty spot-on analysis of the 2016 election. Clinton takes responsibility for the things that were her fault and complains about the things that weren't. There were a lot of reasons she lost, and this book goes through them carefully using the best evidence available.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">O'Neill is at times alarmist, but makes a compelling case that algorithmic thinking is often used to disguise value judgements. I totally agree with her, for example, that the US News and World Report college rankings are literally cancer. It's great to hear this argument coming from a mathematician too -- it would be probably less convincing coming from a social scientist.</p>

Beyond that, the thesis of the book is provocative: meritocracy is creating an unintelligent underclass. It's a perspective on inequality I haven't heard before.</p>

So in 2008, he re-explored his ambitious theory of cognition in a more streamlined, personal book. Some of the whimsy of GEB is traded for blunt emotionality; the loss of his wife plays a role in his thinking on consciousness, and he does not hide this fact from the reader.</p>

My understanding is that this book is like a very broad briefing for a would-be president, arming them with just enough scientific literacy to not do completely stupid things.

      <p class="test-justify">Malcolm X speaks to a perspective on black struggle that seems more honest and less effective. He was right that nonviolence tended to mean defenselessness. He was wrong that it would get black people nowhere.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Cal Newport builds a great framework for accomplishing serious knowledge work. His suggestions are fairly radical (most notably deleting social media). I don't think most people are trying to do the sort of work this book is about, but for those who are, Newport's ideas are worth at the very least considering.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">eCoNoMiC aNxIeTy: the book. Trump is thankfully absent from this book, as are any sort of explicit politics. In its place we have the platonic ideal of the interview with the Rust Belt Trump voter that took over political journalism in late 2016/early 2017.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Alain de Bouton's <i>School of Life</i> videos on YouTube are engaging, but often shallow and pretentious. This book was better. It did not change my life, but it made Proust accessible and made me rethink how I view friendship and the communities I live in.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">I had Sayntani Dasgupta in a class and can confirm that she is just as funny and thoughtful in person as she is in this book. This collection of essays explores contrasts between life in India and life in the United States with insightful wit. I love when she describes streets in the US as "shampooed" when compared with the roads in New Delhi.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">I'll always roll my eyes at writers who insist their names be lowercase (that includes bell hooks). But danah boyd offers a smart, nuanced look at how teenagers use social media. She cuts through parental bogeymen and media hype to show how Instagram of the 2010s is the mall of the 1980s.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="test-justify">This book is interactive. It draws a distinction between fast, instinctive, subconscious thought and slow, reflective, conscious thought, and puts the reader in situations where the strengths and weaknesses of the two systems are made intuitive. Lots of fun.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">It’s hard to find science writing that's meatier than pop science but doesn't feel like homework. I think Greene nails it here. His use of accessible analogies and detailed footnotes makes the book easy to pick up without being too hand-wavey.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">I love that Snicket doesn’t shy away from showing death. He says losing someone is like walking up some stairs, expecting one more step, and then feeling a jolt when your foot keeps falling. I don't think many children’s novels address death as honestly and sensitively as this one.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Philip Gourevitch is a good reporter and strong writer. Unfortunately, he fails to place the Rwandan genocide in context. Without a good anthropological/historical grounding, the book becomes a long gawk at depravity.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Barack Obama wrote this before getting into politics, and it's written with a level of candor you probably wouldn't see from someone on the campaign trail (though I'm sure he always had big ambitions). The prose can get grandiose at times, but his discussions of identity and inheritance are thoughtful and usually unpretentious. You would want this guy to become president after reading this book.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">This Newberry Award winning book is about a road trip to Lewiston, Idaho. I went to college about 40 minutes away from Lewiston and was surprised that someone would write a book about such an unremarkable part of of the country. The author's from Cleveland so she knows how to find good stories in boring places.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">This is the most realistic representation of high school I’ve seen in fiction. It follows a young football star’s changing priorities as he navigates his junior year. The problems he runs into, especially in family life, are ordinary but explored with enough subtlety to be gripping.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Set in the Depression-Era Midwest, this children’s novel deals with some heavy topics. Bud Caldwell escapes an abusive foster home and goes in search of a famous musician he suspects is his father. Bud is funny, scrappy, and a great lens into both the racial and economic turmoil and the jazzy ambience of that period of American history.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Personality is a huge aspect of identity, as important as race or gender. Susan Cain describes the strengths of introverts, and how they can often be crowded out in our extrovert-friendly culture. She is exhaustive in her research and practical in her advice.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">Having survived the Holocaust, the psychiatrist Victor Frankl understood the depths of human suffering. This book is a study of how he was able to find purpose after having everything he knew taken away from him. I like that he doesn't present a universal idea of what meaning is, but rather a process for seeking it out.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">D. Watkins went from selling crack to a Master's degree at Johns Hopkins and a professorship at the University of Baltimore. This collection of essays describes a life on the violent, east side ("Beast Side") of Baltimore unimaginable to most Americans. He gets a bit repetitive and his politics are a bit too radical for me, but his perspective is one that rarely (though more so recently) makes it into the public discourse.</p>

      <p class="test-justify">J.L. Chestnut was the first black attorney in Selma, Alabama. His memoir shows the fear, violence, and jubilation of living in the heart of the Jim Crow South during the Civil Rights Movement. Particularly interesting to me were the descriptions of racial discord in Selma in the 80s and 90s, showing the continuing struggle decades after Bloody Sunday.</p>

      <p class="test-justify"><p class="test-justify">This novel is very much a product of its 1999 release year, centering on a murder during the height of the Satanic Panic. Daniel Handler (who also wrote <i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i> under the name "Lemony Snicket") seems to specialize in writing young characters straining toward adulthood. The high school students here are witty, thoughtful, and written with care.</p></p>

      <p class="test-justify">Pretty much everything you might see in an undergraduate math degree shows up in this book. Steven Strogatz presents it all with a flair for story-telling. He's a great communicator, keeping a nice balance between accessibility and informativeness.</p>

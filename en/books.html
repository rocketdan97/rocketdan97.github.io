        <td>The first three chapters are great: bell hooks presents a clear definition of love and describes how most people don’t experience it. But then she abandons that definition and starts writing crazy shit like “if all public policy was created in the spirit of love, we would not have to worry about unemployment, homelessness, schools failing to teach children, or addiction.” In hooks’ world, everything bad is because of mass media and the patriarchy, and it could all be fixed if we loved each other.

        <td>People of all races use drugs at about the same rates, but the War on Drugs and the resulting explosion in incarceration rates has disproportionately landed on minority communities. Michelle Alexander argues that mass incarceration is a system of racial control of the same scale and nature as slavery and Jim Crow. The absence of an extended discussion of elevated violent crime rates in minority communities and some tenuous historical allusions (she argues building prisons in rural areas boosts population and thus congressional representation in white majority areas in a manner reminiscent to the three-fifths compromise) detract from an otherwise compelling argument.

          This novel is very much a product of its 1999 release year, centering on a murder during the height of the Satanic Panic. Daniel Handler (who also wrote <i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i> under the name "Lemony Snicket") seems to specialize in writing young characters straining toward adulthood. The high school students here are witty, thoughtful, and written with care.

          Pretty much everything you might see in an undergraduate math degree shows up in this book. Steven Strogatz presents it all with a flair for story-telling. He's a great communicator, keeping a nice balance between accessibility and informativeness.

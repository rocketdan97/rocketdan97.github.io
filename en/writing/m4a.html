  <h1>should going to the doctor be like going to third grade?</h1>

  <p>Elizabeth Warren finally explained how she's going to pay for Medicare For All today in a detailed press release.</p>

  <p>To lay my cards out, I'm what some on the left call an "enlightened centrist." I like Buttigieg more than Bernie and tweaks more than revolutions. I also know very little about healthcare aside from broad liberal talking points (America's system is more expensive and less efficient than other countries', health insurance and pharmacy companies have enormous lobbies, et cetera).</p>

  <p>Warren's plan is a breathe of fresh air after hearing her "costs will go down" dodge over and over again. But I think the broader philosophical question about whether healthcare should be a right or a commodity is more fruitful ground for debate than the specifics of a plan that looks nothing like what would come out of even a Democratic supermajority in Congress.</p>

  <p>I don't like the idea that healthcare is a human right. That notion waters down the idea of human rights to "something the government should provide to everyone," or maybe more pointedly, "something it's immoral for the government not to provide in a country with means." </p>

  <p>I don't know much philosophy about human rights, but I prefer the view that rights are something you have independent of society. You would have a right to free speech or a right to practice your faith even if there weren't a government. I know it's pedantic, but it bothers me a lot less when people say there should be a right to healthcare and make explicit that it's a constructed right and not something inherent.</p>

  <p>I saw video being passed around of Bret Baier interviewing Bernie Sanders in one of his Fox News town halls he had, and asking him where the right to health care would come from. Sanders responds "from being a human being" and the crowd responds with cheers. It seems wrong to me. According to Wikipedia (I know), Tajikistan got rid of their constitutional right to free health care for all citizens in 2003. After the Soviet Union fell, a bunch of Russian doctors left the country and their health system failed. For the Tajikistani people, their right to health care did not come from being human beings. It came from having resources. </p>

  <p>So Warren and Sanders want going to the hospital to be like going to third grade: decommodified and accessible to all. I like Sanders' plan more than Warren's, though I've read neither and again, know nothing about health care.
Warren says it can all be done without middle class tax increases, but I suspect that's a campaign lie. </p>

  <p>After reading Warren's plan, I share in leftists' frustrations with how the media frames Medicare for All. The New York Times article that came out about the Warren proposal seems particularly misleading. It seems to suggest that Warren's 20.5 trillion cost estimate is lowballing it. But her plan acknowledges that the future is an unknown and it could cost anywhere from -3.5 trillion to 34 trillion according to the Urban Institute.</p>

  <p>I like how Warren frames the options for healthcare: in Option 1 we continue down the path we're going with 11 trillion in out of pocket costs contributing to 52 trillion over the next ten years. In option 2 we have 52 trillion coming from only the rich. But I'm okay with middle class tax increases. If I were convinced to my left, I think I'd prefer Sanders to Warren. But whatever. I think it should be more like 3rd grade, but Warren's plan makes it even more egalitarian (and more expensive) than third grade.<p>

  <h1>we should talk about fairness instead of privilege</h1>

  <p>Peggy McIntosh’s 1987 essay “Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack” sent waves through social justice circles that reverberate to this day. McIntosh introduced the term “white privilege,” describing the often-unnoticed advantages of being white in America.</p>

  <p>McIntosh’s paper remains worth reading, a simple list of the various ways she benefits from her race.</p>

  <p>But almost three decades on, privilege rhetoric has run its course. Progressives should shift to the language of fairness, and move away from a culture of stigmatizing individuals and embracing victimhood.</p>

  <p>During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in June, Sen. Kamala Harris was interrupted by Sen. John McCain while asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions a question regarding Department of Justice policy. Social media exploded with criticism of McCain’s “manterruption,” heaping snark and indignation at a white male cutting off a woman of color.</p>

  <p>This style of messaging — claiming victimhood before turning on the alleged oppressor with a wave of stigma — has convinced millions of working class whites a reality television billionaire is better tuned to the needs of the poor and marginalized than the Democratic Party.</p>

  <p>Certainly, white privilege has not gone away.</p>

  <p>The Pew Research Center reports the median net worth of white households is 13 times that of black households, and 10 times that of Hispanic households, numbers that have barely budged since McIntosh penned her essay. These statistics, as well as lived experiences of discrimination recounted by people of color should unsettle any American who believes in freedom and justice.</p>

  <p>However, McIntosh’s simple call for awareness has been perverted into a message of guilt and stigma. Instead of appealing to America’s highest values, and explaining how racism, sexism and bigotry run counter to them, the Left often uses privilege rhetoric as a cudgel, beating shame into individuals whose identity groups mark them as oppressors.</p>

  <p>Kamala Harris’ experience of being interrupted by man is far from unique. Every woman — and certainly every woman of color — has been interrupted, patronized or not taken seriously at some point. However, shouting down white males will do nothing to address sexism. Instead, progressives should emphasize fairness and equality for all Americans.</p>

  <p>Inequality, whether economic, racial or based on gender, tears massive rifts through this country. America needs an activist Left calling attention to these divisions. Democracy does not work without some amount of social justice.</p>

  <p>But shut out of the Presidency, powerless in Congress and impotent at the state level, the left cannot make the sort of change needed to build a more equitable society. Democrats recognize their messaging needs to change, with House and Senate Democrats unveiling a new agenda over the summer under the banner “A Better Deal.”</p>

  <p>Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer wrote an op-ed in the New York Times advertising this better deal for workers, a series of policies ranging from a massive infrastructure program to a mandatory $15 minimum wage.</p>

  <p>Economic populism is a good way to win political office — the losers of the last two presidential elections were successfully framed as out of touch elites — but progressives need not abandon women and minorities in order to be successful.</p>

  <p>As the Left moves forward, it can shed the most divisive edges of identity politics while continuing to confront the unfairness of racism, sexism and bigotry.</p>

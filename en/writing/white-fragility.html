      <h4 class="text-center">thoughts on <i>white fragility</i></h4>
      <p class="text-center">july 20, 2020</p>

      <p>This book is bad. Robin DiAngelo's sweeping statements about race and incoherent efforts to foster white identity are unproductive. <i>White Fragility</i> does highlight a dynamic that resonates with many people of color in professional settings: even when done in diplomatic terms, calling out a white person for offensive behavior can lead to a deeply emotional response centered on the person's character rather than how their actions affect others. By packaging this message in academic language, a worldview centered on racial identity, and a snarky title, <i>White Fragility</i> reaches only the already converted.</p>

      <p>I'll start with what I like about the book.</p>

      <p>First, DiAngelo explicitly defines racism. There seem to be two definitions of racism floating around. The first is what usually shows up in a dictionary—prejudice or discrimination on the basis of race. DiAngelo uses the second, which is popular among academics and activists: "racism occurs when a racial group's prejudice is backed by legal authority and institutional control."</p>

      <p>It's so important that she says this upfront. We're at a crossroads in how people define racism, and a norm of saying what one means in situations where it's not obvious would save hours of talking past one another (e.g., this <a href=https://reason.com/podcast/radley-balko-and-rafael-mangual-debate-systemic-racism/>frustrating debate</a>).</p>

      <p>Second, as much as this book has been panned as a <a href=https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/the-capitalist-genius-of-the-anti-racism-industry/> white guilt tract</a>, DiAngelo makes clear that guilt is not a good thing. She writes, "when we are mired in guilt, we are narcissistic and ineffective; guilt functions as an excuse for inaction." Later she says, “I don’t feel guilty about racism. I didn’t choose this socialization, and it could not be avoided. But I am responsible for my role in it.” DiAngelo understands that guilt, like blame, is useless. We solve problems by taking and assigning responsibility.</p>

      <p>Third, white fragility is a useful concept, though it's frustrating that an academic like DiAngelo uses such snide phrasing. I get the sense the real or imagined specter of politically correct HR departments and liberals' domination of media and culture can lead white people to think it's a lot easier to speak out about racism than it is. In my experience, the risk of being seen as difficult to work with leads people of color in professional settings to avoid bringing up all but the most galling or repetitive of offenses. So it's deflating for the response to be defensiveness rather than dialogue.</p>

      <p>And now what I don't like about the book:</p>

      <h5>Academic definitions</h5>

      <p>DiAngelo responds to the idea that a white student being bullied on account of their race is experiencing racism: “While a white person may have been picked on—even mercilessly—by being in the numerical minority in a specific context, the individual was experiencing race prejudice and discrimination, not racism. This distinction is not meant to minimize the white person’s experience, but aims to clarify and to prevent rendering the terms interchangeable and thus meaningless.”</p>

      <p>But the point of the academic definition of racism is to minimize white people's experience of prejudice by noting that anti-white prejudice is not backed by societal power. We could say "racism against people of color manifests differently and more harmfully than racism against white people because of white people's societal power," but instead academics and activists play a semantic game where anti-white racism is definitionally impossible. I'm happy to play along—words mean whatever people want them to mean—but to claim this definition of racism doesn't downplay anti-white prejudice is disingenuous.</p>

      <p>DiAngelo also defines white supremacy in academic terms: “white supremacy in this context does not refer to individual white people and their individual intentions or actions but to an overarching political, economic, and social system of domination. Again, racism is a structure, not an event.” She warns against anyone who might want to reserve this term for Klan members and the alt-right, writing "our umbrage at the term 'white supremacy' only serves to protect the processes it describes and obscure the mechanisms of racial inequality."</p>

      <p>I see two issues with using academic language when writing to a general audience about race. First, it creates an unnecessary barrier between authors and readers who are only familiar with the dictionary definition of racism and the <i>Mississippi Burning</i> definition of white supremacy. Everything in <i>White Fragility</i> could be communicated without trying to convince readers anti-white racism doesn't exist.</p>

      <p>Second, academic definitions quickly lose their usefulness once they leave scholarship. For example, "systemic racism" was a helpful buzzword for politicians who needed to say something during the George Floyd protests, but did little to advance the discourse. Of course the idea that a social structure can produce racially disparate outcomes without explicit racism is useful and important, but it is better communicated specific policies (e.g., how public schools are funded) than with academic abstractions.</p>

      <p>One may counter that terms like "systemic racism" and "white supremacy" as defined by DiAngelo are useful shorthands. Maybe we don't always have time to rehearse the ways America's institutions are unfriendly to people of color. But these words are not useful because they refer to things that are rarely useful to discuss in the abstract. Rather than pointing to racist policies we can do something about, ill-defined structures and systems play the same role as the conspiratorial "they" (as in, "if voting did anything, they wouldn't let us do it").</p>

      <h5>Not distinguishing between ideals and realities</h5>

      <p>DiAngelo takes unrealized ideals like color blindness, objectivity, and individualism, and views them only as roadblocks to fighting racism if not racist in themselves.</p>

      <h6><i>Color blindness</i></h6>

      <p>While discussing the March on Washington, DiAngelo writes, “one line of King’s speech in particular—that one day he might be judged by the content of his character and not the color of his skin—was seized upon by the white public because the words were seen to provide a simple and immediate solution to racial tensions: pretend that we don’t see race, and racism will end.” This is actually a misquote. King didn't imagine he would see a world where he wouldn't be judged by the color of his skin—he dreamt that reality <a href= https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/i-have-dream-address-delivered-march-washington-jobs-and-freedom>for his four children.</a></p>

      <p>So DiAngelo misinterprets a post-racial ideal for anti-racist practice when she later says, “while the idea of color blindness may have started out as a well-intentioned strategy for interrupting racism, in practice it has served to deny the reality of racism and thus hold it in place.”</p>

      <p>She's right that pretending to be color blind can mean willful ignorance of racism. She's wrong to dismiss color blindness as King thought of it.</p>

      <h6><i>Objectivity</i></h6>

      <p>DiAngelo straw-mans the ideal of objective thought, saying the "ideology" of objectivity "tells us that it is possible to be free of all bias." We all have biases, but with help from others, reasonable people are capable of recognizing their biases and getting closer to truth. This is peer review, the basis of objective thinking.</p>

      <p>With her faulty definition of objectivity, DiAngelo writes, "We don't see through clear or objective eyes—we see through racial lenses. On some level, race is always at play, even in its supposed absence." The notion that objectivity is impossible and race is always at play seems like the worst possible thing to bring into conflict (and the most lucrative for diversity counselors like DiAngelo).</p>

      <h6><i>Individualism</i></h6>

      <p>In <i>Dreams from My Father</i>, Barack Obama writes beautifully about being able to see himself as an individual and not a black man when he first visited Kenya: "You could see a man talking to himself as just plain crazy, or read about the criminal on the front page of the daily paper and ponder the corruption of the human heart, without having to think about whether the criminal or lunatic said something about your own fate. Here the world was black, and so you were just you; you could discover all those things that were unique to your life without living a lie or committing betrayal."</p>

      <p>DiAngelo recognizes that being seen as an individual is a privilege, writing, “for people of color, the privilege of being seen (and seeing themselves) as unique individuals outside the context of race cannot be taken for granted.”</p>

      <p>It's bizarre then, that rather than wishing to extend this privilege to everyone, DiAngelo wants to take it away from white people: “Talking about race and racism in general terms such as white people is constructive for whites because it interrupts individualism.”</p>

      <p>For DiAngelo, individualism is a roadblock to racial discourse rather than an unrealized ideal we should work to extend to everyone because it “makes it very difficult for white people to explore the collective aspects of the white experience.” Fostering white identity by encouraging reflection on the collective white experience is a risky approach to social justice for reasons I'll turn to now.</p>

      <h5>Fostering white identity</h5>

      <p>DiAngelo is unclear on how white people should think about their identity. In the first chapter, she says “I was not taught to see myself in racial terms and certainly not to draw attention to my race or to behave as if it mattered in any way.” This is a problem for her: “a critical component of cross-racial skill building is the ability to sit with the discomfort of being seen racially, of having to proceed as if our race matters (which it does).” So seeing oneself as white is important for DiAngelo.</p>

      <p>In <i>White Identity Politics</i>, political scientist Ashley Jardina finds about 30-40% of white people have strong white identities. These are people who answer questions like "How much do you think whites in the US have more in common with one another than they do with racial and ethnic minorities?" strongly in the affirmative. While the vast majority of white identifiers reject assertions of white supremacy and racism, they are far from the woke allies DiAngelo hopes to produce. Identifying strongly with white identity was one of the strongest predictors for supporting President Trump in 2016.</p>

      <p>DiAngelo is not interested in developing a tolerant, healthy white identity opposed to Trumpian nativism. Her thinking on this is worth reading in full:</p>

      <p>“However, a positive white identity is an impossible goal. White identity is inherently racist; white people do not exist outside the system of white supremacy. This does not mean that we should stop identifying as white and start claiming only to be Italian or Irish. To do so is to deny the reality of racism in the here and now, and this denial would simply be color-blind racism. Rather, I strive to be “less white.” To be less white is to be less racially oppressive. This requires me to be more racially aware, to be better educated about racism, and to continually challenge racial certitude and arrogance.”</p>

      <p>I won't hold my breathe waiting for white people to reflect deeply on their whiteness and the collective white experience, reject it all, strive to be "less white," and continually educate themselves on racism. </p>

      <h5>An awful last chapter</h5>

      <p>The final chapter, titled "Where do we go from here?" is a shrug and an exhortation to educate yourself.</p>

      <p>DiAngelo writes “in answer to the question 'Where do we go from here?,' I offer that we must never consider ourselves finished with our learning,” before presenting that ubiquitous list of 2010s anti-racist books—<i>The New Jim Crow</i>, <i>Between the World and Me</i>, et cetera. As much as DiAngelo has to say about systems and structures, she has no systemic solutions beyond white people collectively changing their behavior in unspecified ways they'll need to educate themselves to discover. </p>

      <p>At the start of the George Floyd protests, George Packer <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/protests-are-sign-despair/612724/> wrote </a> it would be a "sign of a hollow democracy if the main energy in the afterglow of the protests goes into small-group sessions on white privilege rather than a hard push for police reform."</p>

      <p>That <i>White Fragility</i>—a book where a white person urges other white people to think more about being white—is third on the New York Times Best Sellers list speaks to a failure in our politics.</p>

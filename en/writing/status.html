  <h1>people think they want status when they really want dependents</h1>

  <p>David Brooks has an article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/11/superiority-complex/302611/"><i>The Atlantic</i></a> from 2002 that reads like he stepped fifteen years into the future:</p>

  <p>"Communications technology has expanded the cultural space. We now have thousands of specialized magazines, newsletters, and Web sites catering to every social, ethnic, religious, and professional clique. You can construct your own multimedia community, in which every magazine you read, every cable show you watch, every radio station you listen to, reaffirms your values and reinforces the sense of your own rightness. It is possible, maybe even inevitable, that you will slide into a solipsism that allows you precious little contact with people totally unlike yourself. But in your enclosed sphere you will feel very important."</p>

  <p>He writes that the fragmentation of our culture has "democratized elitism" allowing everyone to sit atop their niche interests and "look down from the heights of [their] mountaintop at those millions of poor saps who are less accomplished in the field of, say, skateboard jumping, or who are total poseurs when it comes to financial instruments, or who are sadly backward when it comes to social awareness or the salvation of their own souls."</p>

  <p>I was five in 2002 so I don't remember much from then. It suprises me that rather than post-9/11 cohesion, Brooks saw the sprouting of the disintegrated media landscape we see today. We no longer need to curate a self-affirming diet of radio stations and magazines now that Facebook does it for us. We can gain familiarity, expertise, and status in our given domain and look down on the unenlightened. </p>

  <p>The problem with democratizing elitism is that status is hollow. If we think of status as being seen as important within a community, it is nowhere near as satisfying as being important to an individual. We need someone who needs us.
</p>

  <p>American culture often turns our need for others to depend on us into a status competition. Who packed the most nutritious lunch for their kid? Who did the most on Valentine's Day? Social media supercharges this dynamic, with multi-paragraph Instagram captions raking in likes and replacing birthday phone calls.
</p>

  <p>This is such a lonely country.</p>

  <p>David Foster Wallace's memorable commencement speech at Kenyon College notes how our culture affords us "the freedom to be lords of our own tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation." Our new, hyper-specialized media landscape gives these kingdoms the illusion of community.</p>

  <p>I'm not just saying pHoNeS aRe BaD. You can use your phone to FaceTime a loved one or you can use it to confirm your biases on Twitter. What Brooks saw nearly twenty years ago is that the way information is fragmented and yoked to identity is turning public life into an endless flex: I understand this, I belong, I matter.</p>

  <p>We'd all be much happier with a puppy.</p>

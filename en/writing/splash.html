  <h1>splish splash at chipotle</h1>

  <p>"White or brown rice!"<br>
  "Brown rice."</p>

  <p>"Black or pinto beans!"<br>
  "Black, please."</p>

  <p>"What!"<br>
  "Black!"</p>

  <p>The wide-eyed server slides my burrito bowl to the next employee.</p>

  <p>"What kind of meat would you like!"<br>
  "Chicken, and can I have some of the veggie fajitas too?"</p>

  <p>"Do you want cheese!"<br>
  "No, thanks."</p>

  <p>The employee slides the bowl to the next worker.</p>

  <p>"Mild, medium or hot sauce!"<br>
  "I'll have the pico and the corn."</p>

  <p>"Anything else!"</br>
  "No that's it."<p>

  <p>The worker slides the bowl to the cashier, a pudgy man with a septum piercing. He grabs the bowl and mashes some buttons on the register.</p>

  <p>"Any chips or drinks?"<br>
  "No, thanks."</p>

  <p>"That will be $7.25."<br>
  "Can I have a cup for water, please?</p>

  <p>"Yeah."</p>

  <p>He hands me a transparent plastic cup.</p>

  <p>I look at my phone. I walk over to the drink machine. I wonder why restaurants always hide the water button under the Minute Maid lemonade.</p>

  <p>The room is crowded. There's a line of individual stools facing the window. I sit down and lay my phone next to my burrito bowl. I go to nytimes.com. The House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry against the President. The Washington Nationals won the World Series. There are fires in California.</p>

  <p>I stick my fork into the bowl and try to dig deeply enough to get some of the rice. The teachers' strike in Chicago ended. WeWork is a dumpster fire. ISIS named a new leader now that Bagdadhi's dead. I go to washingtonpost.com. Same stuff.</p>

  <p>I pull out my Kindle and dive back into Bhaskar Sunkara's <i>Socialist Manifesto</i>. Maybe the workers here wouldn't be so twitchy and wide-eyed if they seized the means of production. I read two pages about agrarian reform in post-revolutionary China. Socialism is boring. I put away the Kindle.</p>

  <p>I take a few more bites. The chicken is well seasoned. I look at my phone. I go to nytimes.com. Same stuff.</p>

  <p>I need the bathroom, but I threw away my receipt with the code on it. I walk up to the pudgy man. He's busy negotiating guacamole tubs with a construction worker. I look at my phone. The construction worker wants four tubs. The pudgy man warns him they cost extra. The construction worker wants two tubs. The pudgy man chuckles and rubs his nose.</p>

  <p>"Hey, what's the code for the bathroom?"<br>
  "3194."</p>

  <p>"Thanks."</p>

  <p>The room is even more crowded. The line stretches out the door. I'm glad I beat the lunch time rush. I walk through the crowd and toward the restroom. I'm confused by a woman dressed in what looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles onesie. I realize it's Halloween. I realize that's a costume and not pajamas.</p>

  <p>I'm surprised at how clean Chipotle's bathroom is. I look in the mirror. I look older in the mirror than in my head. Good. I hope they don't see me as a child at work. I look at my phone. Lunch is almost over.</p>

  <p>My mind was once a pressure washer. Now it's a kiddie pool.</p>

    <h4>ta-nehisi coates is wrong about white supremacy</h4>
    <p>09/04/19</p>

      <p>The standard woke position on race argues that white supremacy is so deeply entrenched in American life we need radical changes to uproot it.</p>

      <p>The terms are often blurry. "White supremacy" at times refers to a violent ideology of inherent racial difference and at others refers to white people's economic and political dominance. The radical changes tend to lean more on sloganeering (Smash capitalism! Revolution!) than on thoughtful analyses.</p>

      <p>I think the vagueness of the identitarian left's critique of racial power structures in modern America hurts black people.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Matt Yglesias wrote an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020">excellent piece</a> about what he calls "The Great Awokening," the fact that over the past five years white liberals have stampeded to the left of most minorities on issues of race. On the whole this has been a good thing, fueled by writers like Adam Serwer, Nicole Hannah-Jones, and most notably Ta-Nehisi Coates grounding conversations about race in more honest tellings of American history.</p>

      <p>But when it comes to what we do in the present, the left flails. It prefers clever historical allusions, poetry, lived experiences, art, and impassioned rhetoric to concrete ways to improve black lives. Which carries more weight on the left: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/sports/basketball/slavery-anniversary-basketball-owners.html">analogizing the NBA to slavery</a> or the startlingly high black homicide rate?</p>

      <p>Coates' memoir <i>Between the World and Me</i> came out in 2015 to the acclaim of white liberals. It captures the best and worst of the Great Awokening: an honest grappling with history, artful writing, and a collapse into vagueness when it comes to identifying present-day solutions.</p>

      <p>I want to compare <i>Between the World and Me</i> to another book about race released in 2015. In <i>Ghettoside</i>, L.A. Times journalist Jill Leovy follows a murder in South Central Los Angeles from the night of the killing to the murderer's trial. It's an open and shut case because of the unusually dogged work of John Skaggs, a superstar LAPD detective. Leovy makes the case that thorough homicide investigations save black lives, noting that “it’s not the harshness of punishment but its swiftness and certainty that deters crime.”</p>

      <p>Of course, Coates is trying to do something different from Leovy. He is telling his son about his life while she is diagnosing a social issue. But it's difficult to understate the impact of Coates' rhetoric on the woke left. Comparing it to what I feel is more effective advocacy for black lives can help tease out how vague critiques of white supremacy hurt black people.</p>

      <p><i>Between the World and Me</i> is framed as a letter to Coates' son warning him about the precarity of navigating the United States with a black body. Coates places a premium on seeing racism not as an abstraction, but as a specific lived experience: "All our phrasing—race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy—serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth."</p>

      <p>Later in the book he urges his son to envision slavery through the lens of a particular enslaved woman:</p>

      <p>"I raised you to respect every human being as singular, and you must extend that same respect into the past. Slavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific enslaved woman, whose mind is active as your own, whose range of feeling is as vast as your own, who prefers the way the light falls in one particular spot in the woods, who enjoys fishing where the water eddies in a nearby stream, who loves her mother in her own complicated way, thinks her sister talks too loud, has a favorite cousin, a favorite season, who excels at dressmaking and knows, inside herself, that she is as intelligent and capable as anyone."</p>

      <p>Coates' prose is beautiful, calling attention to the physical impact of racism on particular individuals. But he just as easily abandons this specificity, lumping disparate people and phenomena under the vague banner of white supremacy.</p>

      <p>Gone is Coates' directive to "respect every human being as singular" in his infamous reaction to the September 11th attacks: "I could see no difference between the officer who killed [Coates' friend] Prince Jones and the police who died, or the firefighters who died. They were not human to me. Black, white, or whatever, they were menaces of nature; they were the fire, the comet, the storm which could—with no justification—shatter my body."</p>

      <p>Coates' friend had recently been killed by a police officer so one can understand his callousness. But this view that any agent of the state is a non-human, irredeemably oppressive force is toxic. Police officers and firefighters are not some mystical force intent on shattering the black body. They're people. People are often racist, but dehumanizing them changes nothing.</p>

      <p>Coates sees police violence and black-on-black violence in what he calls the "killing fields" of American ghettos as two sides of the same coin: “There is no difference between the killing of Prince Jones and the murders attending these killing fields because both are rooted in the assumed inhumanity of black people...'Black-on-black crime' is jargon, violence to language, which vanishes the men who engineered the covenants, who fixed the loans, who planned the projects, who built the streets and sold red ink by the barrel.”</p>

      <p>It is true that redlining and segregation set the stage for the shocking gang violence we see in American cities. It is also true that Cosby-style calls for black youth to resist street life and better their communities misunderstand what it takes to survive in a bad neighborhood. However, to say that a gang death in one of these neighborhoods is no different from a police killing because they're rooted in racism is like telling an obese person their diabetes is no different from their heart disease. When we say it's all white supremacy, we give up solutions and disempower ourselves. White supremacy is not a permanent, abstract feature of American life. It has a particular presence, much different than the one it had fifty or a hundred years ago, and it is very, very contingent.</p>

      <p>In Ghettoside, Jill Leovy explores the epidemic of black homicide death. Black people have consistently been five to seven times more likely than white people to die from homicide over the past thirty years. In most cases they are killed by other black people. White liberals don't engage with the uncomfortable reality of black-on-black crime. They might highlight its roots in redlining and segregation or note that conservatives use it as a distraction from police violence, but when it comes to concrete solutions, the silence is deafening.</p>

      <p>Leovy tackles the issue head-on. She follows the gang-related murder of a black teenager named Bryant Tennelle. The case is taken on by one of the department's best detectives: John Skaggs solves eighty percent of the homicides placed on his desk, nearly twice the department average. Much of Leovy's book is a study of Skaggs' relentless detective work: “He went back again and again to the same streets, the same houses, knocking over and over, rousting witnesses at dawn or late at night. He learned certain patterns of life in Watts—where junkies loiter, which couch a drug dealer might call home."</p>

      <p>His persistence wins key witnesses and a mountain of evidence. In the end, Skaggs builds a case so compelling the prosecutor says "a seven-year-old could have tried it."</p>

      <p>The vast majority of black homicide victims don't receive this kind of investigation. They die quietly, with no media attention and half-hearted probes from underfunded homicide units. Leovy presents the simple idea that “where the criminal justice system fails to respond vigorously to violent injury and death, homicide becomes endemic.” She discusses how this dynamic plays out among Indian tribes in Canada, Arab citizens in Israel and non-Dutch ethnics in the Netherlands. Through this lens, the appalling black homicide rate seems less ineffable, and more a familiar, solvable pattern among marginalized groups.</p>

      <p>Leovy looks at only one particular element of America's racial caste system. But in narrowing her focus, she does far more to advocate for black lives than blanket condemnations of capitalism, subversive comments about white people or broad critiques of all police officers.</p>

      <p>There is a sizable political majority appalled by discrimination on the basis of race, something that didn't exist not too long ago. Instead of mobilizing this majority toward a more just society, the left's racial politics build on exclusion and internet snark. Demonstrate a lack of fluency with Coates' rhetoric and you will booted away.</p>

      <p>Leovy's specificity does more to help black people more than Coates' racial abstractions. The left needs to shed the excesses of its identity wing and focus in on specific problems to build something resembling racial justice.</p>

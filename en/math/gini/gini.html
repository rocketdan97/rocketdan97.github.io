  <h1>how tf is the gini coefficient half the relative mean absolute difference?</h1>

  <p>Economists use Gini coefficients to measure inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. If everyone has the same amount of things, the Gini coefficient is 0. If one person has all the things and everyone else has nothing, the Gini coefficient is 1.</p>

  <p>There are two ways to calculate Gini coefficients that seem worlds apart. The first is intuitive, but the second seems like magic (to me at least). I'd appreciate if someone who's good at math could explain how they're related in the response section at the bottom of this page. <a href="www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient#Definition"> Wikipedia</a> doesn't, and my research isn't going any deeper than that.</p>

  <h3>the first way: area between line of equality and lorenz curve divided by area under line of inequality</h3>

  <img src="curve2.png" alt="lorenz-curve" class="center" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;">

  <p>The Lorenz curve (above) has the cumulative share of the population on the x-axis and the cumulative total of the resource to be distributed (in this case income) on the y-axis. The line \(y=x\) is the line of equality, the upper limit of the Lorenz curve representing all people having the same amount of things.</p>

  <p>The Gini coefficient is then the grey area in the chart above divided by grey area plus the blue area, in other words, the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve divided by the area beneath the line of equality.</p>

  <p>This feels intuitive and workable to me. It's interesting to think about how different Lorenz curves could give the same Gini coefficient, how all people having the same amount of things leads to a Gini coefficient of \(0\), etc.</p>

  <h3>the second way: half the relative mean absolute difference</h3>

  <p>The relative mean absolute difference is the expected absolute difference between two random variables from the same distribution divided by the distribution's mean. Divide that by two and that's another way to get the Gini coefficient for that distribution.</p>

  <p>How does that have anything to do with the Lorenz curve??</p>

  <h3>responses</h3>

  <p>"Hmm. There has to be some connection between finding the mean absolute difference and integrating." — Beau (paraphrased from phone call) </p>

  <p>"Oh, I see." — Drew </p>

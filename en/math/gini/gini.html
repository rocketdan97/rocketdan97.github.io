  <h1>how tf is the gini coefficient half the relative mean absolute difference?</h1>

  <p>Economists use Gini coefficients to measure inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. If everyone has the same amount of things, the Gini coefficient is 0. If one person has all the things and everyone else has nothing, the Gini coefficient is 1.</p>

  <p>There are two ways to calculate Gini coefficients that seem worlds apart. The first is intuitive, but the second seems like magic. I'd appreciate if someone who's good at math could explain how they're equivalent in the response section at the bottom of this page <i>(update: my friend Drew left a nice proof)</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient#Definition"> Wikipedia</a> doesn't, and my research isn't going any deeper than that.</p>

  <h3>first definition: the area between line of equality and lorenz curve divided by area under line of inequality</h3>

  <img src="curve2.png" alt="lorenz-curve" class="center" style="max-width:50%;height:auto;">

  <p>This Lorenz curve is cumulative income share as a function of cumulative population share. The line \(y=x\) is the line of equality, an upper limit on Lorenz curves representing all people receiving the same income.</p>

  <p>The Gini coefficient is then the grey area in the chart above divided by grey area plus the blue area. In other words, it's the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve divided by the area beneath the line of equality</p>

  <p>This feels intuitive and workable to me. It's interesting to think about how different Lorenz curves could give the same Gini coefficient, how all people having the same income leads to a Gini coefficient of \(0\), etc.</p>

  <h3>second definition: half the relative mean absolute difference</h3>

  <p>The relative mean absolute difference is the expected absolute difference between two random variables from the same distribution divided by the distribution's mean. Divide that by two and that's another way to get the Gini coefficient for that distribution.</p>

  <p>This makes no sense to me. How does that have anything to do with the Lorenz curve??</p>

  <h3>responses</h3>

  <p>"Hmm. There has to be some connection between finding the mean absolute difference and integrating." — Beau </p>

  <p>"It’s not hard if you’re careful about the definitions and know how to take the integrals involved." <i><b>*produces <a href="ginius.pdf"> a proof</a> lovingly typeset in \(\LaTeX\)*</b></i> — ✨Drew, certified Gini-us ✨ </p>

  <p>"I am not a fan of the Gini coefficient as a measure. With administrative data, you can plot the actual distribution of income and just look at that and produce different summary statistics that are more intuitive to people or more useful." — Jesse </p>

  <p>"You’re missing a period after 'equality' in the fourth paragraph." — Gianna </p>

<h3>A thousand doors </h3>
My friend Maria posed this problem on a long car ride:

<br><br>
A thousand people line up in front of a thousand closed doors. The first person opens
every door. Next the second person closes every other door. Then the third person
goes to every third door and "flips" it (i.e., opens it if it’s closed and closes
it if it’s open). Then the fourth person flips every fourth door, the fifth person
flips every fifth door, and so on for all one thousand people.

<br><br>
How many doors are open once they all finish?

<br><br>
I couldn't figure it out, and neither could my other friend Drew, who was also on the road trip.
But when Drew got home he wrote a program to
solve it. It turns out only 31 doors
are open when it's all said and done. This is kind of remarkable — nearly all the doors end up closed. He texted me saying he had figured out why.

<br><br>
The math is actually pretty lit so you should try figure it out for yourself before
you read ahead (Hint: think about how many times you need to flip a door for it to be
open at the end).

<br><br>
Okay so we start by thinking of how many times a door needs to be flipped to be open at the end. It turns out open doors are flipped an odd number of times and closed doors are flipped an even number of times. This makes sense when we think about how many times we need to flip a door to change it from its original, closed state.

<br><br>
There's a nice mathematical way of thinking of how many times a door is flipped: if we label all the doors from 1 to a 1000, the number of times door <i>n</i> is flipped is the number of factors <i>n</i> has. (This is the key breakthrough I made after writing my own <a href="https://github.com/rocketdan97/a-thousand-doors">program</a>.)

<br><br>
So why are there only 31 doors left open? Because the only doors that are open correspond to numbers with an odd number of factors, i.e., perfect squares, and there just aren't that many of those. Tight af.

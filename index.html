I'm still working on this website but it's going to be cool -- I promise. For now, check out this painting Van Gogh made a few months before he died. The whole idea of the 'tortured artist' is bad and inaccurate, but it's hard not to be fascinated by a guy who was poor, depressed and ignored for his entire life and then became a celebrity a few decades after he died. Just like Mendel (and at almost the same exact time too).
